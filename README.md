# Parallel RI on GPUs   

Parallel implenetation of RI algorithm on GPUs using NVIDIA-CUDA. 

The folder RI_Parallel contains the parallel implementation of the RI algorithm. 
The folder RI_Serial contains the original RI algorithm. 

Consider to compile before launching the script, using make in both folders. 
In order to launch the execution and comparation of both codes use the following line: 
$ bash exec.sh
